Kidney Stone Detection Using Matlab
Kidney stones have grown to be a significant issue in modern society. If they are 
not found early, they can lead to difficulties and occasionally require surgery to be 
removed. The approach for detecting kidney stones in humans that is presented 
in this article uses ultrasound speckle suppression.Image enhancement is used 
to first enhance an initial image. Strategies for modifying the image's intensity. 
The picture is then filtered by median filters to remove noise. Using a 
thresholding approach, pre-processed pictures are segmented. The 
recommended strategy makes use of coordinates of a place. Different 
performance measurement metrics have evaluated the proposed plan.
Key Words: Kidney stone detection, image processing, wavelet processing, 
ultrasound images, median filter.
